This course is a continuation of
[CHEM103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/): Organic Chemistry I. 
As you progress through the units below, you will continue to learn the
different chemical reactions characteristic of each family of organic
compounds.  We will focus on the four most important classes of
reactions: electrophilic substitution at aromatic rings, nucleophilic
addition at carbonyl compounds, hydrolysis of carboxylic acids, and
carbon-carbon bond formation using enolates.  The enolate portion of
this course will cover the reactivity of functional groups. We will also
look at synthetic strategies for making simple, small organic molecules,
using the knowledge of organic chemistry accumulated thus far.  At the
end of this course, you will possess the tools you need to plan the
synthesis of fairly complicated molecules, like those used in
pharmaceutics.  From the perspective of a synthetic organic chemist, the
two most challenging aspects of synthesizing drug molecules are the
incorporation of  "molecular rings" (rings of 5, 6, 7, or more atoms)
and/or fused ring systems into the structure of the molecule and the
configuration of the chiral center, which will ensure the desired
optical activity.  For example, the drug Zantac contains amines,
disulfides, and an oxole ring.  By the end of this course, you will be
able to rationalize your way through the synthesis of this drug. This
course also introduces biological molecules, including carbohydrates,
peptides and proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, from a molecular
perspective.  You will learn how chemical reactions, especially
oxidation and reduction reactions, form the basis of all life.  In fact,
plants reduce carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates (sugars), whereas
animals and humans oxidize the food eaten to produce energy. Humans
store this produced energy  in the form of "chemical bonds" (ATP, etc.).
Note that in biology, you would study the functionality of these
structures by asking, “How do they operate?” whereas in the field of
organic chemistry, we ask: “What are they made of?”  We will conclude
this course with a unit on spectroscopy in which you will learn how to
characterize and identify an unknown organic molecule based on its
functional group’s vibrational modes (IR), mass (MS), light absorption
(UV-Vis), and nuclei resonance (NMR). ****

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   identify the chemistry and basic mechanisms of the following
    functional groups: ethers, epoxides, thiols, sulfides, benzene,
    amines, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids and their
    derivatives;
-   plan the synthesis of ethers, amines, and carboxylic acid
    derivatives (esters, amides, etc.);
-   predict the product(s) of an electrophilic addition reaction
    involving conjugated dienes;
-   use the Diels-Alder reaction on conjugated dienes to form new
    carbon-carbon bonds and chiral centers of a desired configuration (R
    or S);
-   determine whether a molecule is aromatic, non-aromatic, or
    anti-aromatic;
-   indicate the position in which an electrophile will be added on an
    aromatic ring, given the other substituents present;
-   identify the products and mechanisms of electrophilic and
    nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions;
-   demonstrate mastery of enolate chemistry and techniques for C-C bond
    formation;
-   plan the synthesis of simple molecules using the reactions learned
    throughout both the Organic Chemistry I and Organic Chemistry II
    courses;
-   describe the chemistry associated with biological molecules such as
    amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates;
-   identify different monosaccharides, disaccharides, aldoses, and
    ketoses, as well as reducing and non-reducing carbohydrates;
-   identify the twenty naturally occurring amino acids and describe the
    mechanisms associated with peptide cleavage and synthesis; and
-   use spectroscopy (mass spectrometry, UV-Vis spectrometry, infrared
    spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance) to characterize an
    organic molecule.

[CHEM002/PHYS102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem002/),
[CHEM003/MA101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem003/),
[CHEM004/MA102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem004/),
[CHEM101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem101/),

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM104: Organic Chemistry II.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements. 

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s *[Virtual
    Textbook of Organic
    Chemistry](http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/alcohol2.htm#ethnom)*
-   University of California, Davis: UC Davis ChemWiki: "[Organic
    Chemistry](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Organic_Chemistry)”

**Requirements for Completion**: A solid understanding of [CHEM103:
Organic Chemistry 1](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/) is required
in order to do well in CHEM104.  In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.

You will need to complete at least one set of practice problems in all
units (except units 2 and 10) as well as a Final Exam.  Note that you
will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.  However, in
order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to work through
the aforementioned problem sets.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **126.25
hours** **** to complete; this time estimate includes optional
resources. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you
plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself.
 For example, Unit 1 should take you 8.75 hours.  Perhaps you can sit
down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 through 1.3
(a total of 4.75 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.4 (4 hours) on
Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions**: As noted in the “Course Requirements,” Organic
Chemistry I is a pre-requisite for this course.  If you are struggling
with the basic functional group structure and nomenclature as you
progress through this course, try taking a break to review
[CHEM103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/). As you read, take
careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Draw each reaction type,
including both reagents and products.  Then, you can use this sheet to
review for your Final Exam.

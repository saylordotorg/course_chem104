**Unit 1: Ethers and Epoxides** <span id="1"></span> 
*Ethers can be distinguished by their carbon-oxygen-carbon bridge
(C-O-C).  Ethers are often used as solvents in organic reactions that
require polar, aprotic solvents (solvents that have no exchangeable or
reactivehydrogens), such as reactions involving Grignard's reagents and
alkyllithium reagents.  Ethers show superior stability towardsreducing
agents and are thus often chosen as solvents for reduction reactions
involving metal hydrides and other reducing metals.  Polymers with an
"ether" structure, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), are important in
the pharmaceutical industry, because they confer solubility to certain
drug molecules, thus enhancing these drugs' absorbance and efficacy. 
Epoxides are ethers characterized by a "tri-atomic," cyclic C-O-C
group.  This cyclic ether group is usually incorporated into larger
structures to confer certain special physical properties or a particular
reactivity to the overall molecule.  For example, the high reactivity of
the epoxide ring is the basis of many glues and adhesives.*

     Instructions: Please click on the links above, and watch the two
    video lectures (11 minutes and 8 minutes, respectively) to learn
    about ethers and how to name them.  Ethers are organic molecules
    which have an oxygen bonded to two alkyl groups.  The general
    formula is R-O-R', where the R and R’ are alkyl groups.  R and R’
    can be the same or different alkyl groups.   
      
     Viewing these lectures and pausing to take notes should take

     Instructions: Read only the section on nomenclature of ethers to
    continue learning about how to name ethers. In organic chemistry,
    ethers and alkanes are treated similarly in the IUPAC system of
    nomenclature. Ethers are named based on the parent alkane using the
    IUPAC system of naming.

**Unit 2: Thiols and Sulfides** <span id="2"></span> 
*Thiols and sulfides are the "sulfur equivalent" of alcohols and ethers.
 You can replace the oxygen atom of an alcohol with a sulfur atom to
make a thiol; similarly, you can replace the oxygen atom in an ether
with S to make the corresponding alkyl sulfide.  This is because thiols
contain the C-S-H functional group, while sulfides contain the C-S-C
group. *  
  
 *Thiols are often called “mercaptans,” a reference to the Latin
term *mercurium captans*(capturing mercury), since the -SH group forms
strong bonds with mercury and its ions.  It is useful to know this
nomenclature, because one day you may be looking for a bottle of
butanethiol but will find that it is labeled butyl mercaptan!  Thiols,
like alcohols, can form hydrogen bonds with other polar, protic
molecules.  However, thiols are usually more acidic and volatile than
are alcohols.  The thiol functional group is incorporated in many
biological molecules, such as the essential amino acid cysteine and the
coenzyme A.*  
  
 *Sulfides are less common than thiols as naturally occurring compounds.
 However, sulfides—especially disulfides (C-S-S-C)—have important
biological functions, mainly in reducing agents (antioxidants).  Note
that the rigid, three-dimensional structure of an antibody is determined
by cross-linking disulfide bonds.        *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Derive the name of thiols and sulfides from their molecular
    structures, and vice versa.
-   Plan the synthesis of a given thiol and sulfide indicating the
    necessary reagents and reaction conditions.
-   Plan the conversion of thiols into disulfides using the appropriate
    reagents and reaction conditions.

     Instructions:Please click on the link above, and study this webpage
    to learn about the nomenclature of thiols.  Then, go through the
    practice problems at the bottom of the webpage.  Note that thiols
    are the sulfur analogies or alcohols, and as with alcohols, they are
    named by identifying the longest chain with the –SH group as the
    base name of the molecule.Please note that this resource requires
    Java.  
      
     This reading and practice problems should take approximately 30
    minutes to complete.

    Then, go through the practice problems at the bottom of the webpage.
    Note that thioethers, also named as sulfides, contain the group
    R-S-R and are named similarly to alcohols. This unit will teach you
    when to name a molecule as a thioether and when to name as a
    sulfide.Please note that this resource requires Java.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instruction: Read the sections on “Nucleophilicity of Sulfur
    Compounds” and “Oxidation States of Sulfur Compounds.” Note that
    thiols and sulfides behave differently from their alcohol and ether
    counterparts. Thiols are much stronger acids than alcohols. Also,
    important is sulfur’s six oxidation states in compounds compared to
    oxygen’s two. Read the sections of this article to understand the
    reasons why.   
      
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes to complete.

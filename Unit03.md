**Unit 3: Conjugated Dienes** <span id="3"></span> 
*Conjugated dienes are “special alkenes” in the sense that these
molecules have two C=C separated by a C-C.  This structure is known as a
conjugated carbon-carbon bond or an alternating double bond.  Here, you
will need to apply your knowledge of resonance to understand the
behavior of reactive dienes and predict the reaction product(s).  The
reactivity of these molecules is substantially different from that of
alkenes which have isolated C=C.  These molecules are thus considered a
different class of organic molecule.  Conjugated dienes, especially
butadiene, are very important materials in the production of rubber, and
thus for the tires of our cars.*

    IUPAC Organic Nomenclature: Polyenes"**
    Link: University of Calgary: Professor Ian Hunt’s ["Basic IUPAC
    Organic Nomenclature:
    Polyenes"](http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/ION-v02/alkenes/alkenes-04.html)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and study this
    webpage to learn about the nomenclature of dienes (polyenes).  Then,
    go through the practice questions at the bottom of the webpage. 
    Note that polyene here means a number of alkenes.  For example, a
    diene has two C=C, a triene has 3 C=C etc.  Dienes are named like
    alkenes.  Learn about how to name dienes in this reading.  
      
     This reading and practice problems should take approximately 30
    minutes to complete.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the section titled “Properties of Dienes.”
    Because dienes have two double bonds in the same molecule, it is
    important to consider the positioning of these bonds relative to one
    another to determine properties. This reading will help you learn
    about the different properties of dienes when the double bonds are
    isolated, conjugated, or cumulated. Make sure to click on any
    embedded links as well as the “Click Here” buttons.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this entire webpage and work through the
    problems to learn about the properties of the conjugated diene
    system. Note that when the double bonds in a diene are conjugated,
    the pi system of electrons is ‘delocalized,’ resulting in special
    stability and reactivity.    
      
     Reading this section, taking notes, and completing the problems
    should take approximately 1 hour.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the sections titled “Addition Reactions” and
    “Diels-Alder Cycloaddition.” Addition reactions of dienes differ
    depending on whether the double bonds are isolated or conjugated.
    Isolate dienes react similarly to alkenes. Conjugated dienes react
    by two different mechanisms to produce a 1,2- and a 1,4 addition
    product. Read on to learn about these addition reactions of dienes,
    kinetic verses thermodynamic control, and the diels-alder reaction
    or a conjugated diene, which gives a cycle product.  
      
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take 1 hour to
    complete.

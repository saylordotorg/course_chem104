**Unit 4: Benzene and the Other Aromatic Compounds** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Benzene is considered the "parent" molecule of all aromatic compounds.
 Aromatic compounds are characterized by a network of delocalized
electrons in Pi orbitals.  The aromatic system confers an enhanced
thermodynamic stability to the molecule (i.e. it is more stable than if
the same molecule had isolated Pi bonds).  Aromatic systems react very
differently from the other functional groups you have encountered so far
in this course.  The most typical reaction is electrophilic
substitution, where one substituent at the aromatic ring (this can be an
H, a halogen, etc) is substituted with another group (an acyl group or a
nitro group, for instance). Simple aromatics are usually obtained from
the distillation of crude oil and then used as building blocks for the
synthesis of larger molecular structures.  Aromatics have numerous
applications, including plasticizers and solvents.  In this unit, you
will learn how to plan the modification of aromatic systems with the
goal of synthesizing more valuable products.*

-   Derive the name of aromatic compounds and substituted benzene rings
    from their molecular structure, and vice versa.
-   Describe aromatic systems using molecular orbital theory and
    determine whether a molecule is aromatic, anti-aromatic, or
    non-aromatic.
-   Identify the properties of phenols verses aliphatic alcohols.

**4.2 Phenols (Aromatic Alcohols)** <span id="4.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s
    *Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry*: “Phenols"**
    Link: Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s *Virtual
    Textbook of Organic Chemistry:*
    [“Phenols"](http://resources.saylor.org.s3.amazonaws.com/CHEM/CHEM104/CHEM104-4.2-Phenols-CCBYNCND_files/CHEM104-4.2-Phenols-CCBYNCND.htm#alcrx5)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the section titled “Phenols." Scroll down to the
    problem set labeled “Reactions of Alcohols and Phenols” from the
    drop down menu, and follow the instructions on the webpage to
    complete the problem set. The problems on alcohols will give you a
    refresher and allow you to compare those with those of phenols.  
      
     Phenols are organic compounds having a hydroxyl group bonded to an
    aromatic ring. Chemically, phenols behave differently from alcohols.
    One important difference between the chemistry of phenols and
    alcohol compounds is that for the most part, phenols do not
    eliminate or undergo substitution of the hydroxyl group in chemical
    reactions; recall that alcohols do. This section will aid your
    understanding of this difference in reactivity.    
      
     Reading, taking notes, and completing the practice problems should
    take approximately 3 hours.

    under which conditions an aromatic system becomes an electrophile.

     Instructions: Please complete this assessment after working through
    subunit 4.3.2.  At the bottom of the webpage, choose a practice
    problem from the scroll down menu and practice on the topic you
    want/need.  These practice problems will reinforce what you have
    learned in this unit about amine nomenclature, synthesis, and
    reactions.  There is also a multi-step synthesis for you to work
    through.  This resource covers subunits 4.1-4.3 and all their
    inclusive sub-subunits.  
      
     You should dedicate approximately 2 hours to practicing with these
    problem sets.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and watch this video
    (\#1) in its entirety (10:33 minutes) to learn how to synthesize
    substituted benzenes using multiple reactions.  Complex molecular
    structures containing aromatic rings are often produced using
    "multistep synthesis". In multistep syntheses, the final product is
    assembled throughout a sequence of chemical reactions.  In this
    section, you will learn how to utilize different types of reactions
    to produce the desired molecule.This resource covers subunits
    4.1-4.3 and all their inclusive sub-subunits.

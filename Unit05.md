**Unit 5: Amines** <span id="5"></span> 
*Amines are organic compounds containing a nitrogen atom in a low
oxidation state.  This nitrogen retains its lone pair of electrons and
the characteristics of a strong Lewis base.  There are other organic
compounds that contain nitrogen atoms in their structure, but this
nitrogen-based group might have higher oxidation states and/or be a weak
Lewis base, as with nitro and imide compounds.  Amines can be primary,
where the N atom is bound to one carbon (C-NH2); secondary, where the N
atom is bound to two carbons (C-NH-C); or tertiary, where the N atom is
bound to three carbons (C-(N-C)-C).  Amines can be aliphatic or
aromatic.  It is also possible to bind a fourth group to the N atom,
forming in this case a quaternary ammonium salt.  Amines are basic
compounds (Lewis bases) that generally react as nucleophiles.*

    relative to the synthesis of 1º-Amines.  Recall that primary amines
    are those amines with a nitrogen attached to two hydrogen and to an
    alkyl group.  Ammonia can undergo alkylation with alkyl halides to
    produce primary amines.  However, primary amines can be produced in
    two step process.  Primary amines produced in this alternate fashion
    are purer and produced in higher percent yield.  Read on to learn
    how to produce primary amines with the use of a nitrogen nucleophile
    and a carbon electrophile.  This resource also covers subunit 5.2.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    section titled “Reactions of Aryl Diazonium Salts.”  Aryl diazonium
    salts are intermediates in substitution reactions where nitrogen is
    given off. The stability of the nitrogen molecule being given off
    helps drive the reaction.  A wide variety of substitution products
    can be produced depending on the reaction conditions and reactants. 
    In this lesson, you will learn about the Sandmeyer reaction and
    other important reactions where aryl diazonium salts act
    intermediates.

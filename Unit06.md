**Unit 6: Aldehydes & Ketones** <span id="6"></span> 
*Aldehydes and ketones are the first compounds we have seen in this
course that contain the carbonyl functional group.  This group entails a
carbon-oxygen double bond, or C=O.  If the carbon atom is bound to at
least one hydrogen atom, it is an aldehyde.  If C is bound to two other
carbons, then it is a ketone.  Aldehydes and ketones react mostly via
nucleophilic addition, where a nucleophile attacks the electron-poor
carbon of the carbonyl group.*

     Instructions: In the chapter “Aldehydes and Ketones” linked above,
    read sections 1, 2, and 4. Skip 3: “Synthetic Preparation of
    Aldehydes and Ketones.”  Aldehydes and ketones are characterized by
    the carbonyl functional group, C=O.  Because carbon can accommodate
    four bonds, there are two bonds available for a hydrogen or an alkyl
    group.  Aldehydes have at least one hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl
    carbon while ketones have no hydrogens but rather two alkyl
    groups.

     Instructions: Please click on the links above, and read these
    sections about reactivity of aldehydes and ketones in their
    entirety.  Note that an important feature of aldehydes and ketones
    chemistry is that the carbonyl carbon reacts readily to incoming
    carbon nucleophiles (partial negative carbons).  As a result,
    reactions of aldehydes and ketones are a useful means to lengthen
    the carbon chain to produce more complex organic molecules.
     Aldehydes and ketones will also easily undergo substitution
    reactions at an alpha carbon.  You will learn about these reactions
    in this section as well as a mechanism for the nucleophilic addition
    reaction.  This resource covers subunits 6.3.1-6.3.6.

**Unit 7: Carboxylic Acids** <span id="7"></span> 
*Carboxylic acids are characterized by the presence of a COOH group in
the molecular structure.  This group is called the carboxyl group.
 These compounds are the most common acids you will encounter in this
organic chemistry course. A few carboxylic acids you may be familiar
with are citric acid in fruits and acetic acid in fruits, and lactic
acid in spoiled milk.*

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions:  Read the entire section linked here.  Many of the
    reactions used to prepare carboxylic acids are oxidations.  This is
    due to the high oxidation state of the carboxyl functional group. 
    As we learned in earlier subunits, carboxylic acids can be
    synthesized via oxidation of arene substituents, primary alcohols,
    alkenes, and alkynes.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions:Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    section, “Reactions of Carboxylic Acids.”  Because they are acids,
    carboxylic acids react with bases to form salts and also undergo
    substitution of the hydroxyl hydrogen.  The hydroxyl group can be
    exchanged by a nucleophilic group.  This is the general mechanism
    for preparing the various carboxylic acid derivative functional
    groups.  You will learn each of the reagents used to convert a
    carboxylic acid to the various acid derivatives and the mechanism
    involved in these reactions.

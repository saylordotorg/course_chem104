**Unit 8: Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Esters, Amides, Anhydrides, and
Acyl Halides** <span id="8"></span> 
*Substitution of the OH group in carboxylic acids can yield a variety of
products, including esters, amides, anhydrides, and acyl halides.  This
unit explores the physical and chemical properties of these
derivatives.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the first
    section of the webpage titled “Carboxylic Acid Derivatives.”  This
    section covers “Background and Properties” and “Nomenclature.”  We
    have learned that carboxylic acids are organic molecules which have
    a hydroxyl group bonded to an acyl group.  In derivatives of
    functional, the –OH group is substituted by groups like halo,
    alkoxyl, and amino.

    the bottom of the page, do not click on Part II.  You will continue
    reading on to Part II of this chapter later in another unit in this
    course.  The order of reactivity of the carboxylic acid derivatives
    are: acyl halides \> anhydrides \>\> esters ≈ acids \>\> amides.  In
    this subunit, you will learn how to carry out the reactions of the
    acyl group substitution, which is the most important reaction of
    carboxylic acid derivatives, as well as all the other reactions.

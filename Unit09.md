**Unit 9: Enols and Enolates and Alpha Substituted Carbons** <span
id="9"></span> 
*This short unit will deal with just enols and enolates.  The reactions
we will cover in this unit are highly important because they are among
the most widely utilized methods of forming newcarbon-carbon bonds. 
Most of thesereactions follow the general trend of deprotonating a
carbon alpha to a carbonyland subsequently using the alpha carbon as a
nucleophile to attack electron-poor molecules or functional groups
(electrophiles).*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 7 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 1 hour

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Estimate the acidity of the alpha hydrogen(s) (pKa).
-   Describe the mechanism, reagents involved, and conditions for
    reactions involving the alpha carbon of carbonyl compounds.
-   Plan the synthesis of complicated molecular structures involving the
    formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.

**9.1 Acidity at the Alpha Carbon and Reactions of Carboxylic Acid
Derivatives** <span id="9.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s
    Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry: “Carboxylic Acid Derivatives:
    Reactions of the a-Carbon”**
    Link: Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s *Virtual
    Textbook of Organic Chemistry:* [“Carboxylic Acid Derivatives:
    Reactions of the
    *a-*Carbon”](http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/crbacid3.htm#react5)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the entire
    section entitled “Reactions of the *a-*Carbon” in the “Carboxylic
    Acid Derivatives” chapter.  Carboxylic acid derivatives undergo
    electrophilic substitution to form enols and enolate anion
    intermediates.  These reactions are similar to the keto enol
    tautermer of ketones.  As with the ketone reactions, the carboxylic
    acid derivative need to have at least one (alpha) hydrogen on the
    alpha carbon.  This resource covers subunits 9.1 and 9.2.  
      
     Reading and taking notes should take approximately 1 hour to
    complete.

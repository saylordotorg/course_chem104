**Unit 10: Molecules of Biological Importance** <span id="10"></span> 
*The human body functions through thousands of chemical reactions
happening every minute, either sequentially or simultaneously.  The
human body could be seen as a synthetic chemist constantly at work,
overseeing the synthesis of proteins, oxidation of carbohydrates,
hydrolysis of peptide bonds during digestion, etc.  In this* *unit,you*
*will* *learn how the most basic rules and mechanisms of chemical
reactions also apply to biological molecules. *

    “Carbohydrates” chapter. Carbohydrates are the largest group of
    organic compounds in living systems.  Carbohydrates are the
    photosynthetic product when green plants use the sun’s energy to
    make their food.  Carbohydrates are important, because they provide
    energy for carrying out metabolic in both plant and animal systems.
     The topic of carbohydrates coves glucose, drawing carbohydrates
    (Fischer Projectionslearned in
    [CHEM103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/)), reactivity of
    monosaccharides, aldoses, ketoses,and anomers, disaccharides, and

     Instructions: Read the “Proteins, Peptides, and Amino Acids” and
    “Peptides & Proteins” chapters linked above.  Proteins are organic
    compounds that are important to all living cells.  Proteins are made
    of amino acids and are necessary for living cells to function.  They
    are a part of our skin, hair, DNA, just to name a few.  When the
    amine and carboxylic acid groups in an amino acid join together,
    they form an amide.  Many of these amide units (amino acids) linked
    together form a peptide bond which makes up proteins.  In this
    subunit, we will learn about alpha amino acids, isoelectric point,
    reactivity, synthesis of amino acids, peptides, primary structure of
    peptides, secondary and Tertiary Structure of Peptides, and
    quaternary structure of proteins.

     Instructions: Read the entire chapter linked here.  DNA and RNA,
    the two nucleic acids, are the basic building blocks of life.
     Living cells are able to replicate using DNA as a blueprint.  Each
    person’s DNA is unique and can be used to identify that person.  The
    exceptions are in the cases of identical twins that have the same
    DNA.  Each DNA and RNA molecule is made of a sugar, a base pair, and
    phosphate.  DNA and RNA have three of the same bases and one that is
    different. In this subunit, we will learn about nucleotide bases,
    DNA, and RNA, secondary structure of DNA, double helix, and
    biological activity of acids.  
      
     Reading and taking notes should take approximately 2 hours to

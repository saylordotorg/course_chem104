**Unit 11: Spectroscopy** <span id="11"></span> 
*After you perform a reaction in a chemistry lab, how do you know
whether it actually worked?  Spectroscopy is the answer!  Spectroscopy
is the method by which chemists elucidate the structures of a molecule. 
Proton NMR (also known as Hydrogen-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or
<sup>1</sup>H NMR) is by far the most powerful tool an organic chemist
uses to study molecular structures, and is used on a daily basis in a
synthetic laboratory.  However, proton NMR alone might not be able to
distinguish between very similar molecules, such as hexadecylamine
(C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>35</sub>N) and octadecylamine
(C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>37</sub>N).  Therefore, chemists use other
spectroscopy tools in conjunction with proton NMR.  Mass Spectrometry
can easily discriminate between hexadecylamine and octadecylamine, for
example.  IR spectroscopy can confirm the presence of the amino group
(primary amine), and UV-VIs might be able to estimate the concentration
of these molecules in solution.*

    discovered.  Chemists primarily use laboratory spectroscopic
    experiments to provide credible evidence for the structures of
    organic compounds.  The major spectroscopic techniques will be
    demonstrated in the following topics: mass spectrometry,
    ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy,

     UV radiation is invisible to the human eye and occurs next to the
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, on the high energy
    side.  This high energy contributes to the incidence of cancer and
    other harmful effects of the sun’s UV rays.  UV-Visible spectroscopy
    is most useful in determining the concentration of a sample (Beer’s
    Law) and in determining if conjugation is present in the molecule.
     The Electromagnetic Spectrum, UV-Vis Absorption Spectra, and the
    importance of conjugation will be demonstrated.

     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, or NMR for short, is one
    of the most useful techniques used to determine the structure of
    organic compounds.  Unlike the other spectroscopic methods, only NRM
    can stand alone for the complete analysis of a sample and
    identification of the structure.  NMR makes use of the chemical
    shifts of protons in a molecule.  The presence of equivalent and
    nonequivalent protons, splitting and coupling of nonequivalent
    protons, and coupling constants are assessed to make an
    identification of the compound.
